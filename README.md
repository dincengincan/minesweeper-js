# Minesweeper Game

Simple minesweeper game clone with pure JS.

The main challenge of this clone was to cover all the `core functionalities` from the original game in the shortest time possible. So UI / UX and interactivities such as difficulty/score board/countdown etc. are missing.

If I decide to continue this project game in the future, here are the tasks:

- [ ] countdown
- [ ] difficulty options
- [ ] smiley face to indicate game result
- [ ] fix UI and make it more mobile friendly
